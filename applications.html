            <h1>Applications</h1>
            <p>Astraverse is an upcoming Minecraft Java server aimed to provide the best experience for everyone - opening for a closed beta soon. </p>
            <p>This is a huge project - bigger than any of us on the team have ever tried before. We have committed to making a server that everyone can enjoy - and we have already taken hours of work and started to upgrade servers just so everyone can have the best experience. To help us make sure that we can deliver an optimal experience while maintaining speed of updates, job applications have now opened. </p>
